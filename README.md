## py
for py obviously its ez. just do:
```
python recursion.py
```

## js
you can either run it on the terminal:
```
node recursion.js
```
or you can:
1. `cat recursion.js`
2. drag and `ctrl + shift + c` (heavily dependent on terminal)
3. do `mkdir {anyfoldername}`
4. make `{anyfikename}.html`
5. now you can either
    - paste into `<script>` tag
    or
    - make `jwjsiejekem.js`
    - paste source

## lua
like py, its also ez. just do
```
lua recursion.lua
```

## java
java is also kinda ez do. just:
1. ```
javac Recursion.java
```
